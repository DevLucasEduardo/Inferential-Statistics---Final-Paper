Inferential Statistics - Final Paper

Advanced Planning & Scheduling (APS) is the activity responsible for 
sequencing production lines in the Production Planning and Control (PCP) sectors. Its 
use is key to maintaining the fluidity of the process and ensuring that tasks are finished
in time. In APS, there are sequencing rules and methods, which are sorting algorithms 
that optimize processes. The goal of this work is to statistically analyze the 
performance of the rules in different scenarios and compare them with each other. 
Thereby, it is possible to understand when each algorithm is recommended according 
to the situation and what are the advantages. To do that, the algorithms were recreated 
using the programming language called Python to sequence task lists. After that, 
randomly generated samples were collected also in Python to get the confidence 
interval of the resultsâ€™ averages obtained in different scenarios. Also, discrete event 
simulations were created in FlexSim Software to get the performance results in 
practice. This work brings an in-depth perspective on the gains of rules and methods 
and how they behave in different situations.
